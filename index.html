<p id="welcome-p" class="hardware-ps"> Welcome to my personal website! This website is here to show
    what I have learned throughout my time in Computer Science class, and the amazing coding skills that I have learned.
    On this website you can learn about me, what is HTML/CSS, and different parts in a computer/hardware.

<h2 class="header" id="about">About me!</h2>
<div id="p2">
<h3 class="subheader">Who am I?</h3>
<p id="about-p" class="hardware-ps">
    Hello! My name is Jordan and I am in the 9th grade, attending Summit Shasta High School.
    I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a full Brazilian, and I can speak and understand Portugese.
    Many people describe me as really funny, caring, energetic, and joyful. 
</p>

<h3 class="subheader">Favorite Things/Hobbies!</h3>
<p class="hardware-ps">
    One of my favorite things I enjoy is playing video games. My favorite video game is
    Counter Strike for the pc. I got into Counter Strike because, my friend told me that I should play and it turned out that I really enjoyed it.
    Another thing that I really enjoy is soccer. I have been playing soccer since I was 4 years old and I really enjoy it. 
    I currently play as a right center midfielder or a center defender. My favorite soccer player is Neymar. You can probably guess why he is my favorite player (He is Brazilian, like me!).

<h2 class="header" id="purpose">Purpose of the class!</h2>
<div id="p3">
<p id="purpose-p" class="hardware-ps">
    Computer Science has always been something that intrest me since the day I began playing video games.
    Now that I have the chance to take this class, I really got to explore and enjoy Computer Science.
    The purpose of Computer Science is to understand how computers are used. Currently our class is learning HTML/CSS, and how it is applied
    to webdesign. By the end of our 2 week class, we will have created our own website based off of what we learned, which is the website you are currently on!
